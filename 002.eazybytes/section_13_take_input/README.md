# Accept input using BufferedReader and Scanner 

First let us see how to get output from the java program

System.out.print() --> not change the line

System.out.printf()--> formatting of given data type

System is class ,out is final static variable as used by class name ,then we have method name 


in is another static variable used to take input which is of InputStream!!

```java
public final class System {

    private static native void registerNatives();
    static {
        registerNatives();
    }

    /** Don't let anyone instantiate this class */
    private System() {
    }

    public static final InputStream in = null;

   
    public static final PrintStream out = null;


```
so out gives a object of Prinstream!!

In Printstream class we have all the methods like printf(),println() and others!!


## Understanding System.out.println()
In Java, `System.out.println()` is a method used to print data to the standard output stream, typically the console. It belongs to the `java.io.PrintStream` class and is widely used for debugging, logging, and displaying information to the user.
### Syntax
The syntax of `System.out.println()` is as follows
```java
System.out.println(data);
```
Here, data can be of any primitive `data` type or an object. Multiple parameters can also be passed, which are automatically converted to strings and then printed.
#### Example
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;
        String message = "Hello, world!";
        
        // Printing integer variable
        System.out.println("The number is: " + number);
        
        // Printing string variable
        System.out.println(message);
        
        // Printing multiple variables
        System.out.println("Number: " + number + ", Message: " + message);
    }
}
```
```java
The number is: 10
Hello, world!
Number: 10, Message: Hello, world!
```
#### Key Points
- `System.out.println()` automatically adds a newline character after printing the data.
- It can be used with any primitive data type or object.
- The method is overloaded to handle different types of parameters.
- It's commonly used for debugging purposes to print variable values and messages.
### Conclusion
Understanding `System.out.println()` is fundamental to Java programming. It's a versatile method for printing data to the console and is essential for debugging and communicating with the user.

We have seen in object already above so let see how to take input from console!!

## System.in.read()
`System.in.read()` is a method in Java that reads a single byte of data from the standard input stream (`System.in`). It primarily reads bytes of data, making it suitable for handling low-level input operations. This method can be useful in scenarios where more sophisticated input handling, such as reading strings or other data types, is not required.
### Syntax
```java
public static int read() throws IOException
```
#### Example
```java
package com.eazybytes.input;

import java.io.IOException;

public class JavaBasicInputDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        System.out.println("Please enter a value...");
        int num = System.in.read();
        System.out.println("The user entered a value: "+ num); // It will display the ASCII value of entered number
    }

}
```
### Return Value
- Returns the next byte of data from the input stream as an integer in the range 0 to 255. If the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned.

Output:
```text
Please enter a value...
41
The user entered a value: 52
```

Reason:

It looks like you expected to enter 41, but the program read 52 instead. This issue occurs because System.in.read() in Java reads bytes, not integers directly. It captures the ASCII values of characters, including the newline character (\n or Enter key).

Why Did This Happen?
If you typed 41 and pressed Enter, System.in.read() processes:

'4' (ASCII 52)

'1' (ASCII 49)

'\n' (ASCII 10)

>Note: it is not going to read 1 only reading 4 and printing its ASCII value so we need some alternative of it!!

### Exceptions
- IOException - If an I/O error occurs.
### Notes
- This method reads only one byte at a time, making it suitable for handling raw byte input. For reading characters or strings, consider using higher-level input operations provided by classes like `Scanner` or `BufferedReader`.

- Since `System.in.read()` reads bytes, it may not handle multibyte characters correctly in all cases, especially when dealing with character encodings beyond the ASCII range.

- Always wrap the call to `System.in.read()` within a try-catch block to handle any potential I/O errors.


## BufferedReader
BufferedReader is a class in Java that reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines.

BufferedReader is implemetation of abstaract class Reader class!!It also read the data in Bytestream format!!

BufferReader has 2 constructor

No default constructor here

1. take Reader as input only --> it makes buffer of default size of 8KB , it read 8KB data at once and put in memory and process one by one from memory!!

2. Take Reader as input as well as size --> makes buffer of given size

### Example
```java
package com.eazybytes.input;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class BufferedReaderDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
        BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(isr);
        System.out.println("Please enter a value...");
        //do not use read() use readLine() as read () works same as System.in.read() it gives ASCII of first char
        String input = bf.readLine();
        System.out.println("The user entered a value: "+ input);
        bf.close();
    }

}
```

Output:

```text
Please enter a value...
345
The user entered a value: 345
```

For reading data from keyboard we use InputStreamReader

For reading data from file we use FileReader

>Note:do not use read() use readLine() as read () works same as System.in.read() it gives ASCII of first char
`String input = bf.readLine();`

>Note: BufferedReader always give ouput in String format!!

>Note: we always need to close BufferedReader and Scanner object!!If you do not close it may create memory leak in production!!


### Example for identify even and odd numbers
```java
package com.eazybytes.input;

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;

public class BufferedReaderDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(System.in);
        BufferedReader bf = new BufferedReader(isr);
        System.out.println("Please enter a value...");
        String input = bf.readLine();
       // System.out.println("The user entered a value: "+ input);
       // till now input os string so need to convert to int
       int number = Integer.parseInt(input);
       if(number % 2 == 0){
           System.out.println("You have entered even number");
       }else{
           System.out.println("You have entered odd number");
       }   
        bf.close();
    }

}
```
### File Reader from BFR

```java

public class FileReaderWithBFR {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws  IOException {
        FileReader fileReader = new FileReader
                ("/Users/eazybytes/Desktop/story.txt");
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(fileReader);
        String line;
        //read line by line and stop at null line i.e. EOF
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null){
            System.out.println(line);
        }
        reader.close();
    }

}

```
see bufferreaderExercise too!!

## Scanner 
>Note:The `Scanner` class in Java is used to parse primitive types and strings from the standard input.

In scanner we no need to tell which StremReader to use!!for bufferedReader it was 2 step process but here it is one step process!!

By default it's buffer size is 1KB and we cannot change it!!

```java
public final class Scanner implements Iterator<String>, Closeable {

    // Internal buffer used to hold input
    private CharBuffer buf;

    // Size of internal character buffer
    private static final int BUFFER_SIZE = 1024;

```
see 1024 Bytes !!

#### Example
```java
package com.eazybytes.input;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class ScannerDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter your name:");
        String name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter your age:");
        int age = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Hello "+ name+ " , you are "+ age+" years old.");
        sc.close();
    }

}
```
if you have a string as input we use `nextLine()` do not  use `next()` for string as next() only reads first word and after space it will give error!!


here we need not handle IOException unlike BufferedReader as Scanner itself handles that!!

## Java Logging

Problems with System.out.println() in Production:
- No Log Levels

    System.out.println() prints everything to standard output without differentiating between INFO, DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, etc.

    Logs should have severity levels so you can filter them based on importance.
- No Flexibility

    You can't easily control where the logs go (console, file, external logging systems like ELK, Splunk, or CloudWatch).

    Logs should be configurable for different environments (development, testing, production).
- Performance Issues

    System.out.println() is synchronous and slow because it directly writes to the console.

    In high-performance applications (like web servers handling thousands of requests per second), logging frameworks handle output more efficiently.
- Lack of Formatting and Context

    Logging frameworks allow structured logs with timestamps, thread names, and contextual information.

    Example:
`
log.info("User {} logged in at {}", username, LocalDateTime.now());`
- Difficult to Disable or Redirect

    If you use System.out.println(), you can't easily turn off or redirect logs without modifying the code.

    With a logging framework, you can change settings in a config file (e.g., logback.xml, log4j.properties) without touching the code.

Logging is an essential aspect of software development, providing insight into the behavior of applications during runtime. In Java, the `java.util.logging` package offers a straightforward logging solution that comes bundled with the JDK.
### Features
- Logging configuration
- Log levels (INFO, WARNING, SEVERE)
- Writing log messages to console and file
#### Example
```java
package com.eazybytes.log;

import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class LoggingDemo {

    private static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(LoggingDemo.class.getName());

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        logger.setLevel(Level.SEVERE);
        logger.info("This is info level logging");
        logger.log(Level.WARNING, "This is warning level logging");
        logger.severe("This is severe level logging");
        System.out.println("Hello using System.out.println");
    }

}
```

The output of your code will be:
```text
SEVERE: This is severe level logging
Hello using System.out.println
```
####  Explanation:
logger.setLevel(Level.SEVERE);

This sets the logger to only log messages of SEVERE level or higher.

Any logs below this level (INFO, WARNING) will not be displayed.

`
logger.info("This is info level logging");`

INFO level is lower than SEVERE, so it is not printed.

`
logger.log(Level.WARNING, "This is warning level logging");`

WARNING level is lower than SEVERE, so it is not printed.
logger.severe("This is severe level logging");

SEVERE is equal to the set level, so it gets printed.

`System.out.println("Hello using System.out.println");`

This is a direct println statement, so it always prints to the console.



### Usage
- The `Logger` class is used to log messages in your Java code.
- Log messages can be categorized into different levels such as INFO, WARNING, and SEVERE.
- Use appropriate log levels to convey the importance of log messages.
- Log messages can be directed to different destinations such as console, file, or custom handlers.
### Conclusion
- Logging plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of Java applications during runtime. By integrating logging into your projects, you gain valuable insights into the execution flow, identify issues, and monitor application health.

- This Java logging example demonstrates the fundamental concepts of logging, including configuring log levels, directing log output to different destinations, and utilizing the `java.util.logging` package effectively.

- With the knowledge gained from this example, you can enhance the robustness and maintainability of your Java applications by implementing logging practices tailored to your specific use cases.
